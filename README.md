# Analysis of COVID-19 Impact and GDP Per Capita (2020-2022)

## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic affected nations differently, not only in terms of health outcomes but also economic impact. This report explores:

How GDP per capita correlates with COVID-19 cases and deaths.
Whether economic status played a role in pandemic severity.
Trends in economic recovery post-pandemic.
The dataset includes 177 countries with yearly data on GDP per capita, COVID-19 cases, and deaths.

## Raw Data Overview

### COVID-19 data
- Active Cases
- Cumulative Cases
- Cumulative Deaths
- Daily New Cases
- Daily New Deaths

### GDP per Capita data
- Country Name
- Country Code
- Indicator Name
- Indicator Code
- Year
- GDP per Capita

## Key Findings
### COVID-19 Impact: Cases & Deaths
Countries with larger populations generally had higher total case counts.
The number of daily new cases and deaths peaked in 2021, followed by a decline in 2022.
Fatality rates varied significantly across countries due to healthcare quality and government interventions.

Global GDP per capita slightly increased from 2020 to 2022, suggesting economic recovery post-pandemic.
Some low-GDP nations saw declines, indicating greater economic damage.
High-income countries recovered faster.

The correlation analysis between GDP per capita and COVID-19 impact metrics revealed:

Weak negative correlation (-0.2 to -0.3) between GDP per capita and COVID cases & deaths.
No strong evidence that higher GDP per capita led to fewer COVID-19 cases or deaths.
Possible explanations:
Wealthier countries conducted more testing, leading to higher reported cases.
Lower-income countries had underreporting issues.
Variations in government responses (lockdowns, vaccinations, healthcare capacity).

### COVID-19 Trends
![covid deaths   cases](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5034b857-22fe-44b1-92ec-ca6610a94ff6)

Cases peaked in 2021, followed by a decline in 2022.
Deaths also peaked in 2021, showing a lagging impact of severe cases.
The decline in 2022 are attributed to improvement in treatments, vaccionations, social distancing.
