# COVID-19 Impact and GDP Per Capita (2020-2022)

## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic affected countries in different ways, both in terms of health and the economy. This report examines whether a countryâ€™s GDP per capita influenced its experience with COVID-19. Did wealthier countries have fewer deaths? Did lower-income nations suffer more? The report also looks at how economies began to recover after the peak of the pandemic.

## Overview of the Data  

### COVID-19 Data:
- Total cases  
- Total deaths  
- Active cases  
- Daily new cases  
- Daily new deaths  

### GDP per Capita Data:
- Country name  
- GDP per capita  
- Year  

## Key Findings  

### COVID-19 Cases and Deaths Over Time  

Unsurprisingly, larger countries recorded more total cases. However, the severity of outbreaks varied based on healthcare and government policies. COVID-19 cases peaked in 2021 before dropping in 2022. Deaths followed a similar pattern but declined more slowly, likely due to vaccine rollouts and better treatments.  

At the same time, GDP per capita showed a slight increase from 2020 to 2022, suggesting that some economies began recovering after the pandemic.

### Does Wealth Affect COVID-19 Impact?  

There was a weak negative correlation -0.2 to -0.3 between GDP per capita and COVID-19 cases and deaths. In simple terms, wealthier countries tended to have lower death rates and fewer cases per capita.

### GDP per Capita vs. COVID-19 Deaths

Many low-income countries reported fewer total deaths. However, as time passed, deaths increased across most nations. Richer countries generally had lower death rates, likely due to better healthcare systems and access to vaccines.  

### GDP per Capita vs. COVID-19 Cases

Most low-income countries had fewer reported cases, but the numbers varied widely. Some wealthier nations had high case counts, possibly due to higher testing rates.  

Countries with a GDP per capita above $100,000 tended to have lower death rates, reinforcing the idea that stronger healthcare systems helped limit fatalities.  

### Total Cases vs. Total Deaths

As expected, countries with more COVID-19 cases also had more deaths. However, the death rate was not the same everywhere, some countries had significantly more deaths per case, likely due to healthcare or government action.  

A concentration of countries in the lower-left of the scatter chart had relatively low case numbers and low deaths. These were often smaller nations or those with stricter pandemic control measures. Some may have also underreported cases.
